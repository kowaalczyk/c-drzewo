1st project of the 2nd semester at University of Warsaw.

The project was aimed at testing our knowledge of pointers and structures from the 1st semester. We also had to learn how to use make and how to create basic testing scripts in bash. Unfortunately, project description and all comments were written in polish, but feel free to contact me for translation if You need it.

See /zadanie.pdf for full description.
